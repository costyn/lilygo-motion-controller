# Initial Request

**Date**: 2025-09-30 20:07
**Session ID**: 2025-09-30-2007-protocol-sync-updates

## User Request

In this requirements session, we are going to be:

1. **Updating the protocol between the controller and the webapp** - to ensure that when the motor is being moved, regular status updates are being sent to the webapp to ensure the state is synced.

2. **Check current variables/types in datamodels** - such as PositionUpdate and MotorStatus

3. **Reference documentation**:
   - CLAUDE.md
   - README.md
   - webapp/README.md
   - requirements/ folder for previous session summaries

4. **Testing constraints**:
   - Controller is lying on desk (not connected to limit switches or motor)
   - Goal: ensure state is always in sync between controller and webapp
   - User can paste serial output if needed
   - WebSocket connection possible at http://lilygo-motioncontroller.local/ws/
   - Serial port connection attempts have not worked previously

## Key Focus

Ensure continuous state synchronization between controller and webapp during motor movements through regular status updates via WebSocket protocol.

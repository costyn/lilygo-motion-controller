# Discovery Answers - Tech Debt Review

## Q1: Should the refactoring maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing WebSocket protocol?
**Answer:** No

**Details:** No deployed systems yet. Breaking changes are acceptable, but should be careful and incremental. Test and compile frequently (tests, tsc, pio run) to catch issues early.

## Q2: Are there any real-world deployment constraints that limit refactoring scope (e.g., memory, flash)?
**Answer:** Yes

**Details:** Staying with current ESP32 microcontroller. User doesn't expect outlined changes to push past flash limit, but should monitor build size during refactoring.

---

## Q3: Should the new abstraction layer (datamodel) include validation/safety limits for all motor parameters?
**Answer:** No

**Details:** Current safety parameters are sufficient. No need to add new validation beyond what's already implemented.

---

## Q4: Can existing unit tests be used as regression tests during refactoring?
**Answer:** Yes

**Details:** Unit tests exist but have limited coverage. Haven't been a recent focus. Use what's available but don't rely on comprehensive test coverage.

---

## Q5: Should this refactoring address all identified issues in one session, or prioritize the most critical ones first?
**Answer:** Yes (address all issues)

**Details:** User wants professional opinion on whether abstraction layer is needed. Tackle all issues in this session.

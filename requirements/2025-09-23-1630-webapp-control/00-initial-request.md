# Initial Request

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-23 16:30

## User Request
I want to start making the webapp that will control this project. Please check CLAUDE.md, and README.md to get more details. I've put all my webapp requirements in app/webapp-requirements.md. Please make all edits in this session there (apart from the requirements data). If you doubt the backend/controller has support for a feature, you can go ahead and check the source code of the controller. The webapp should use the websocket(s) of the controller, not rest api. Thanks

## Key Requirements Noted
- WebApp to control the LilyGo Motion Controller project
- Use WebSocket API (not REST API)
- Requirements are in app/webapp-requirements.md
- Need to verify controller WebSocket capabilities
- Should follow project documentation patterns

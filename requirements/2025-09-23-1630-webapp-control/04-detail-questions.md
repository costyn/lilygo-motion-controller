Based on the codebase analysis and your discovery answers, here are the detailed technical questions:

## Q6: Should the jog buttons (forward/back) use continuous movement while pressed or discrete step movements?
**Default if unknown:** Continuous movement (more intuitive for jogging, matches industrial control patterns)

## Q7: Should the webapp validate position limits client-side before sending commands to prevent invalid moves?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (better user experience with immediate feedback, reduces unnecessary WebSocket traffic)

## Q8: For the debug console panel, should it auto-scroll to show the latest messages or allow users to scroll back through history?
**Default if unknown:** Auto-scroll with option to pause (matches console behavior expectations)

## Q9: Should the preset positions in Phase 1 include both position and speed settings, or just positions?
**Default if unknown:** Both position and speed (more flexible for different use cases like fast positioning vs precise movements)

## Q10: Should the webapp work offline after initial load (Progressive Web App) or require constant connectivity?
**Default if unknown:** No offline mode (motor control requires real-time connection for safety)

# Discovery Questions

**Timestamp:** 2025-09-23 16:30

Based on the codebase analysis and webapp requirements, here are the key discovery questions to understand the webapp requirements:

## Q1: Will the webapp need to work on mobile/tablet devices for field control?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (stepper motor controllers are often used in field applications where mobile access is essential)

## Q2: Should the webapp maintain connection state across network interruptions?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (industrial control applications require robust reconnection handling)

## Q3: Will users need to control the motor remotely from different locations/networks?
**Default if unknown:** No (typically used on local WiFi network for safety and latency reasons)

## Q4: Should the webapp store user preferences and settings locally in the browser?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (better user experience with persistent settings like theme, preset positions)

## Q5: Will multiple users potentially control the same motor controller simultaneously?
**Default if unknown:** No (single-user control prevents conflicts and ensures safety in motor operations)

*Note: These questions will be asked one at a time to gather specific requirements for the webapp implementation.*

## Overview

This requirements session successfully identified and implemented 5 critical high-priority features for the LilyGo Motion Controller project. All features were designed to enhance debugging capabilities, improve usability, and provide comprehensive testing without breaking existing functionality.

**Problem Statement:** The LilyGo Motion Controller had complete core functionality but lacked essential debugging tools, network convenience features, and testing capabilities needed for professional development and deployment.

- **Objective**: Consistent timestamped logging across all modules
- **Implementation**:
  - LOG_ERROR, LOG_WARN, LOG_INFO, LOG_DEBUG macros
  - Format: `[HH:MM:SS.mmm] [LEVEL] [FUNCTION]: message`
  - Dual output: Serial console + debug WebSocket stream
  - Configurable log levels via build flags
  - All existing Serial.printf calls converted
- **Result**: Professional logging system with structured output

  - 20 comprehensive tests for `calculateSpeed()` and `updateTMCMode()`
  - Dual environment setup: native for testing, ESP32 for production
  - Test coverage includes edge cases and boundary conditions
- **Result**: 100% test success rate, rapid development validation

## Implementation Notes - COMPLETED

### Architecture Decisions Made
- **Debug WebSocket**: Chose real-time streaming over circular buffer to prevent connection flooding
- **Logging Integration**: Used weak linkage to connect util.cpp logging with WebServer debug streaming
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained webapp compatibility while supporting modern command format
- **Testing Strategy**: Native-only testing for calculation functions, keeping ESP32 environment for production

### Development Experience Improvements
- **Network Access**: No more IP address hunting - mDNS provides consistent hostname
- **Debug Workflow**: Real-time browser debugging eliminates need for serial cable access
- **Testing Speed**: Instant native tests accelerate development cycles
- **Command Visibility**: Full traceability of WebSocket communication for troubleshooting

### Technical Innovations
- **Dual WebSocket Architecture**: Clean separation of control and debugging concerns
- **Unified Logging**: Professional-grade logging system with minimal performance overhead
- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Platform-independent validation of critical algorithms
- **Zero-Dependency mDNS**: Native ESP-IDF implementation without additional libraries
